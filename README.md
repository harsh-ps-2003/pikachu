A privacy preserving BFT DHTs implementation.

### Reference

Thanks to the authors of these wonderful papers for inspiring me for this personal project :

* [Towards Practical Communication in Byzantine-Resistant DHTs](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/akate/publications/RobustP2P.pdf)
* [Adding Query Privacy to Robust DHTs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.1072)

### Disclaimer 

This project was undertaken to deepen my understanding of decentralized p2p networks after taking the course EE698C at IIT Kanpur.

Not designed to be used in production!
